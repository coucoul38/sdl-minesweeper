**A minesweeper with a graphical interface, made with SDL2**

- You can choose the difficulty (how many mines there will be)

Left click to uncover a mine<br>
Right click to place a flag

This is basically an upgrade of my <a href="https://github.com/coucoul38/minesweeper/blob/master/README.md">console minsweeper</a>
